 *   - ADR-0025 â€” Audit WAL with Opaque Payloads & Writer Injection
 *   - adr0026-dbauditwriter-and-fifo-schema
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Side-effect registration of the DbAuditWriter under the stable name "db".
 * - Allows AuditApp (or test harnesses) to dynamically import this file via:
 *     await import(process.env.AUDIT_WRITER_REGISTER)
 *   ...to register the writer without hardcoding it in the app.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - No barrels or shims.
 * - No environment reads or conditional logic.
