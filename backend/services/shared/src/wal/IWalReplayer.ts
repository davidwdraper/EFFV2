/**
 * NowVibin (NV)
 * Docs:
 * - SOP: docs/architecture/backend/SOP.md (Reduced, Clean)
 * - ADR-0025 â€” Audit WAL with Opaque Payloads & Writer Injection
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Lean interface for WAL crash/recovery replay.
 * - Reads journaled lines and re-emits canonical `AuditBlob`s to a writer.
 *
 * Design:
 * - Destination-agnostic; no DB/HTTP assumptions.
 * - Idempotency is owned by the writer/destination (safe to resend).
 * - Cursor strategy is implementation-defined (cursorless default OK).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - No environment reads here; impls get all config via ctor.
 * - Keep this tiny; implementations can add diagnostics via their own methods.
