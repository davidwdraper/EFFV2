/**
 * NowVibin (NV)
 * Docs:
 * - SOP: docs/architecture/backend/SOP.md (Reduced, Clean)
 * - ADR-0025 â€” Audit WAL with Opaque Payloads & Writer Injection
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Destination-agnostic writer interface for flushing WAL records.
 * - Implementations: MockAuditWriter (initial), DbAuditWriter, HttpAuditWriter, ZeroGWriter, etc.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - `writeBatch` MUST be idempotent or harmlessly deduplicate; WAL replay can resend items.
 * - Throw on failure (no silent fallbacks). WAL will retain items for later replay.
