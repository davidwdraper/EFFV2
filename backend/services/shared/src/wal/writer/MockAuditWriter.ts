/**
 * NowVibin (NV)
 * Docs:
 * - SOP: docs/architecture/backend/SOP.md (Reduced, Clean)
 * - ADR-0025 â€” Audit WAL with Opaque Payloads & Writer Injection
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Minimal, destination-agnostic writer that ALWAYS succeeds.
 * - Used to validate WAL ingest/flush plumbing before any real sink exists.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - No side effects. Does not log, does not mutate inputs.
 * - Optional artificial latency via ctor option to simulate downstream delay.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Keep this boring and reliable. All durability comes from the WAL journal.
 * - Replace with a real writer (DB/HTTP/etc.) via the writer factory when ready.
